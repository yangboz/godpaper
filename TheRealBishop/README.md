About:

TheRealBishop project code base translated on TheKnightErrant by ActionScript3 language.

Also based on the great open source project Sparrow framework.

Notes and tips:

#1.All of AS3 featured "protected/private" function translate to "public" at Obj-c level;
#2.All of AS3 featured "interface" functions translate to "protocol" at Obj-c level;
#3.All of AS3 featured "internal class" must be seperated as stand-alone class files at Obj-c level;
#4.All of AS3 single class files must be seperated ".h" && ".m" files at Obj-c level;(except Obj-c protocol)

TODO list:

#1.an objective-c "Vector" template class implementation required;
#2.more unit test on "ds" relevant class and protocol class files;
#3.double check the objective-c pointer and reference translation;
#4.
