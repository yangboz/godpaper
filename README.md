GODPAPER:[http://smartkit.tech/website/godpaper](http://123.207.143.33:84/godpaper/) (民间棋类游戏WIKI)

# About
A flash & ios board game framework named GODPAPER(code name:"the real knight"&"the real bishop") by as3 & objective-c language.
This wiki is dedicated to all the unsung heroes of the world, those who the absence of which
would degrade all our lives to the point where the sweet release of death would seem
preferable to continuing this mortal existence. Ironically, the absence of those I refer to
would all but guarantee this outcome!
I of course refer here to the constants of the physical world:

**G**, the gravitational constant, whose vigilance secures us to this very world;

**O**, oops;

**D**,electric displacement field,also called the electric flux density;

**P**,kilogram meter per second (kg m/s);

**A**,area;

**P**,pascal (Pa);

**E**,the electric constant, which gives rise to the properties of the electromagnetic fields our technology depends upon;

**R**,Electrical resistance;

# Main features
This wiki is for programmers. More precisely, it's for programmers who favor the 'learn by example' approach.
I don't know about you, but I've ready plenty of flash games where all they present are fragments of applications and small, contrived bits of code to illustrate a given point. Now, without question, that is sometimes precisely what you want. Oftentimes, however, what you really want is a whole application that is explained in its entirety so you can see how all the pieces fit together as you explore it little by little. This is precisely what this wiki seeks to do.
